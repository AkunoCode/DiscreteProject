# Statify (Mean, Variance, Standard Deviation Calculator)
## CSDS102 - Discrete Structures 2 (Finals Project)

Statify is a simple calculator that computes the mean, variance, and standard deviation of a given set of numbers. It also displays a table of values for the given set of numbers.

This project is in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the course CSDS102 - Discrete Structures 2.

### Features:
- Mean
- Variance
- Standard Deviation
- Table of Values
- Learning Materials

### How to use:
1. Enter the numbers you want to compute in the input field.
2. Click either the "Population" or "Sample" button to compute the mean, variance, and standard deviation.
3. The mean, variance, and standard deviation will be displayed below the input field along with the table of values.
4. Click the buttons in the "Learn More" section to learn more about the concepts of mean, variance, and standard deviation.
